# Feedback

Thank you for taking this test, we are very happy that you dedicated a bit of your time to Wenabi ðŸ’›.

**_How many hours did you work on this mini project ?_**

---

It took me 15-20 hours, much more than I expected...

- Around 7 hours for the backend to implement a clean architecture with simple unit tests and some integration tests runinng of push with a github action. I associated Profile entity to the User one using JPA. Endpoints are ASSOCIATION_ROLE based and users must be authenticated to retrieve their data.
- The rest for the frontend. It took me a few hours to get back to my habits with Angular. I'm not very confident in how I designed this. To save time, I didn't implement a login page. There is only one page that uses the default-association_user credentials with association_role to load the data and adapt it to the mockup.

**_1 - How do you feel about the workload that was necessary to complete the mini project ? Would you say it was too much or too little ?_**

- I understand that it is essential to have an opinion on many skills that I could have but I found the workloads too high in a way...

**_2 - How would you change this exam and/or examination process?_**

- The statistics part may be too much. It adds lots of feature in web interface with the filter that take time to implement.
